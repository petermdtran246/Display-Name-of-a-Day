# Display Name of a Day
This C++ program determines the day of the week (Sunday, Monday, etc.) based on a user-provided integer representing the day number (1 for Sunday, 2 for Monday, and so on).

## Switch Statement:

The function uses a switch statement to check the value of day and print the corresponding day name:
  -  case 1: If day is 1, print "sun" (Sunday).
  -  case 2: If day is 2, print "mon" (Monday).
  -  Similar cases for day values 3 to 7.
  -  default: If day doesn't match any of the cases above, print "Invalid day".
